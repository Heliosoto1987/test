## Project test for soamee

I loved doing this project... I wanted to do many more things but for work reasons I couldn't dedicate more time to it. I love reacting and that's why I cheekily chose it for this project.
I know that there is much more to be done with this application, including route protection, proper endpoint management and many more, but I am very happy with the result.
